## Introduction

Hi friends!
In this post I'll share the habits that boost my focus and fuel my body with superfoods. Years of experimenting—100% huel diet, keto, you name it—led me to routines that keep me energized and ready to produce excellent code <Twemoji emoji="nerd-face" />.

Try your own experiments to find what clicks : bananas don't vibe with me but they might vibe with you!

My routine might feel repetitive at first, but it’s easy to stick with, and the payoff is awesome!

## Morning Routine

- **Dental Care:** I use a **hydroxyapatite toothpaste** instead of fluoride. Hydroxyapatite remineralizes enamel, supports a balanced mouth microbiome, and avoids the potential disruptions that fluoride can introduce—an often overlooked aspect of your health ([Check Huberman labs episode about it](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7diuJcLrtRHejylWFIinqe?si=f0ab3925453b4e1b)).

- **Sun exposure:** I try to get at least 5min of direct (not through a window) sun exposure as soon as I wake up. Then longer exposure in the afternoon, after 4pm.

- **Movement Warm-Up:** My morning movement flow starts with a spinal “wave” to awaken the vertebrae, followed by dynamic mobility drills, and ends with alternating cat/child poses to lubricate joints and wake the nervous system up.

## Calisthenics for Neuroplasticity

In the afternoon, 3-4 times a week, I do a concise calisthenics circuit, blending exercises like:

- **Handstand:** Stimulates the vestibular system, improving balance and spatial awareness + strengthens shoulders and core.
- **L-sit to Handstand on Bars:** Builds on handstand benefits, emphasizing dynamic shoulder stability and strength during transitions. Engages core muscles intensely, particularly hip flexors and lower abs.
- **Push-ups:** Targets chest (pectorals), shoulders (deltoids, depending on the inclination), and triceps. It must end in [protraction](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6Cqp03P8sHo&ved=2ahUKEwifx_SSj-WNAxWZ0gIHHRhUAAYQtwJ6BAgKEAI&usg=AOvVaw1jrHZ-_XpCs7hC2HfdzXjm).
- **Strict Pull-ups:** Primarily works the back, shoulders (deltoids), and biceps. Engages core for stabilization. Improves grip strength too.

These exercises serve as good foundation to deliver a powerful endorphin boost for mood and motivation while spiking [BDNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor) to enhance neuroplasticity, sharpening both mind and muscles.

## Nutritional Powerhouses

- **Beef Liver pills:** A micronutrient-dense source of vitamin A, iron, and B12—perfect for brain and blood health.
- **Creatine from Beef:** Naturally boosts muscle strength and cognitive function without synthetic supplements.
- **Kefir & Fermented Foods:** Daily kefir and ferments support both my oral and gut microbiomes for improved digestion and immunity.
- **Beef & Bone Broth:** Rich in collagen, amino acids, and minerals for joint health and recovery.
- **Fish oil:** Rich in omega-3s, which are essential for brain health and inflammation reduction.
- **Fruits:** Raspberries and dates are my go to fruits. Both are high in fiber, packed with micronutrients and antioxidants.
- **Honey:** Sidr honey boosts immunity, fights bacteria and viruses, reduces inflammation, aids digestion, and promotes skin health. Combining it with kefir and raspberries will blow your mind!
- **Raw milk butter:** Rich in vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin K2, and omega-3s. I use it exclusively to cook, no vegetable oils.

## Sourcing

Quality is key, both for yourself and the planet.

- **Toothpaste:** Gutology
- **Meat (including organs and bones):** Ideally organic but at least grass-fed (and preferably grass finished)
- **Fruits:** Organic and, if possible, regenerative. Medjool dates are my top choice. Deep frozen raspberries to reduce cost, preserve nutritional value, and reduce inconvenience
- **Kefir:** Ideally homemade with raw milk, but fermentation makes pasteurization more digest (lactose is digested by bacterias)
- **Honey:** Raw, organic, unprocessed/unheated. My fav is Sidr honey from Yemen
- **Fish oil:** I like wild alaskan salmon oil, but avoid at any cost farmed fish stuffs

## Conclusion

Over the past 12 months, I’ve been sticking these routines and focusing on nutrient-rich meals, while cutting back on processed foods (with a few cheat meals here and there for balance).

It’s been a game-changer—my productivity and overall wellness have skyrocketed, my sports performance has noticeably improved, and I’ve finally sorted out those annoying digestive and liver issues.

Try it!
