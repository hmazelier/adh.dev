## Motivation

> Forked with purpose — because sharing is learning!

I forked this blog from [Leo's blog](https://github.com/hta218/leohuynh.dev) which is also a fork of [Timothy's starter blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) to make it my own space for documenting and sharing what I’ve learned as a software engineer.

Writing things down helps me deeply understand new ideas, and I hope this forked version can still serve as a helpful reference for other developers interested in software engineering, health or dopamine related topics.

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.
