## Introduction

Welcome! I‚Äôm a creative native iOS developer who loves exploring a variety of technologies.

It makes sense to mention, considering the name of this blog, that I was diagnosed with ADHD early on.

What once felt like a curse turned out to be a blessing and I want to talk about it : managing your dopamine isn‚Äôt just important for people with ADHD ‚Äî it‚Äôs a key to focus, success, and happiness for everyone.

I'll also mention that I am addicted to sports (my favorites are Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and calisthenics) and I am always looking for ways to improve my performances.

## Why This Blog?

Over the years, I‚Äôve worn many hats: engineer, tinkerer, and sometimes guinea pig. Along the way, I‚Äôve picked up all sorts of insights. This blog is where I collect and share those discoveries.
In short, I'll :

- **Centralize Knowledge**

- **Encourage Experimentation**

- **Relay crusty findings**

- **Document My Journey**

- **Share random shit**

## Technical Stack

Since I‚Äôm primarily an iOS developer, I didn‚Äôt set out to become a full‚Äêstack web guru. But I do want a solid, maintainable blog ‚Äî one that‚Äôs easy to update, looks clean/minimalist, and scales without much overhead. Here‚Äôs what I chose:

- **Fork of the talented Leo's blog : [leohuynh.dev](https://www.leohuynh.dev)**

  - Itself is a fork of the popular [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
  - Gives me an excellent foundation without reinventing the wheel.
  - Didn't want a massive wordpress nor a blackbox! I like the simplicity of markdown for posts along with the possibility to inject react components.

- **React & Next.js**

  - Server‚Äêside rendering for fast initial loads.
  - File‚Äêbased routing makes adding a new post as simple as dropping a Markdown file in the `/data/blog` folder.

- **Contentlayer**

  - Transforms Markdown frontmatter into typed data automatically.
  - I get TypeScript inference for my post metadata, which cuts down on typo‚Äêsurfacing errors.

- **Tailwind CSS**

  - Utility‚Äêfirst styling that‚Äôs easy to extend.
  - Consistent design tokens without wrestling with a massive custom CSS file.

- **Vercel**

  - Instant deployments on every Git push.
  - Zero‚Äêconfiguration SSL, caching, and edge functions out of the box.

- **Spline**
  - I used spline to create the 3d Keyboard.

Each new post lives under `/data/posts` as a `.mdx` file. Because of Contentlayer, I get full type safety on frontmatter fields like `title`, `date`, `tags`, and `summary`.

## What to Expect

Over the coming weeks and months, you can expect posts on topics such as:

- **SwiftUI stuffs**: Mainly architecture related and/or open source projets
- **AI stuffs**: iOS or mac apps plugged to AI apis
- **Node/Bun stuffs**: Showcases of what I consider clean architecture
- **Infrastructure stuffs**: Examples of IaC on AWS with pulumi
- **Dopamine Hacks & Productivity**: Brief experiments I run ‚Äî dry fasting, animal based diet, sports etc..
- **Random shit**: Past travels or my portfolio from a past life as a model. That kind of shit.

I‚Äôll aim for **practical code examples** whenever possible. If a dopamine hack comes through, I‚Äôll log my subjective mood before and after, plus any biometric data.

## How to Follow Along

- **RSS Feed**: `/feed.xml` (auto‚Äêgenerated)
- **GitHub Repo**: I‚Äôll push every change to a public repository so you can track the exact commits‚Äîespecially useful if you want to clone the site.
- **GitHub Discussions / Issues**: If you spot a typo, want to suggest a topic, or have a variant of a hack that worked for you, open an issue or discussion on the repo.

## Conclusion

Whether you‚Äôre here for software development stuffs or dopamine management experiments, I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity. I‚Äôve learned that the act of _writing_ about a hack or workflow often uncovers gaps in my own understanding‚Äîso thank you for being here, helping me learn, too.

Happy coding, experimenting, and optimizing üöÄ

## PS:

A portion of my posts will often be generated by AI (including this one). I usually start by throwing down the key points of what I want to say.

The AI then takes those notes and builds the initial structure. Once that draft is ready, I go through it, tweak any phrasing, correct details, and make sure it sounds like me before I commit/push _(because, let's be honest, chatGPT likes to fuck flies)_!
