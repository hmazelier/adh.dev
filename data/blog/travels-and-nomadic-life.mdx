## My Nomadic Journey

Since the pandemic, I’ve been incredibly fortunate to work remotely, which opened the door to exploring countless regions around the world.

Each place brought new experiences, cultures and lessons! I’ve always savored every moment, fully aware that this lifestyle could change with family commitments or new work constraints.

## Embracing Discomfort

Traveling hasn’t always been easy.

There were times I fell sick alone in unfamiliar places or struggled to find foods that fit my diet.

And while I’m not shy, I often had to venture out alone to truly connect and meet extraordinary people.
Still, I’ve always believed, in a stoic way, that seeking discomfort is essential. Pushing through those moments has been just as rewarding as the destinations themselves.

## Looking Ahead

This post is designed to evolve over time. Below is a map displaying all places I’ve visited or lived in, progressively updated as my journey continues.

## Technical Details

The graphical components in this post are injected using MDX capabilities. I’m leveraging **mapbox-gl** and **react-map-gl** to render an interactive, real-world map that highlights every region I’ve explored. As I add more locations, the map will update automatically to reflect my evolving travels.

Stay tuned—this map will continue to grow as I add new pins and regions, showcasing a visual history of my nomadic life.
